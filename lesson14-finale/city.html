                <h2>The Kenai River</h2>
                <P>Soldotna is home to the legendary Kenai River, with so many creatures who partake in its bounty. every 
                    millions of Red salmon travel up the river from the ocean to spawn and lay eggs in the Skilak lake. ever
                    heard of brother bear? remember when they go to that haven full of salmon? yes it really is like that, no
                    exageration. Salmon upon Salmon go running up the river and you see them in the boats loads. it has even 
                    spurred a tradtions and season called dip netting, during this time usually set up around when the salmon begin to run
                    all those who have a fishing license are able to take there little dip nets and take to the river to catch anywhere from
                    three to six fish per day. </P>
