                <h2 class="dp-headline-1">Principle 1</h2>
                <p class="dp-paragraph-1"> Art is more than a photograph taken or a painted painting. It is an expression, a style, and environment. When you hang a painting up on the wall you do so with the intent to complete your home or place of work. It sets the tone, creating a specific feeling to all those who enter the room. Is your style a homey feeling that reminds you of being in the woods? a reflection of your religious faith? A token of your lifelong commitments and obligations. Whatever your desire, or scene you want to create this is what art is and we want to help you build that feeling. Art is a journey that we love to keep going on and creating. </p>

                <!--second principle -->
                <h2 class="dp-headline-2">Princple 2</h2>
                <p class="dp-paragraph-2"> There are many different types of paintings down to the medium used, brushes applied, and the material used for the artwork. We focus on making each painting unique with alternating between acrylics, watercolor, and oil paints. Some of our older paintings were solely painted with acrylics whereas now we are trying some new mediums of watercolor which has been adding some new flare to our artwork we are excited for. Occasionally we will use the medium of oil pastels or charcoal for a specific effect. Different brushes create a different feeling and tone to the painting, making it soft or more rough looking with texture. Each stroke is used with precision and purpose. We have used many different materials for paintings, such as, canvas, watercolor paper, to even wood panels. The paintings are created in our studio in our house and usually take several hours or days to create. Our paints, brushes, materials used to paint on, are bought with making sure they are of quality that is satisfactory for our customers. We want these paintings to be a prized possession in your home, office, or as gift to a friend.</p>

                <p class="dp-paragraph-3">A painting of your temple, or a painting of your mountain, these painting give your home what it needs. We believe in art to serve as focus of joy in your home. The artwork we create is filled with time from the artist and thought put into each painting. Each piece of artwork speaks a theme or message to the viewer we hope all can enjoy with every one of our artworks. Quality is an important motto for us as we create these paintings, we want you to be able to go home with a painting you fall in love with the view, strokes, color choice, message conveyed, etc. We are also always looking for suggestions for new ideas our customers want and are willing to try new things.  So, feel free to message us anytime! </p>
