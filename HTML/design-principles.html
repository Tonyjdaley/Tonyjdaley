                <pre class="dp-headline-1">Rule of thirds  <a href="https://www.sealionart.com/store.html">Sea lion art store</a></pre>
                <p class="dp-paragraph-1">The rule of thirds is a simple enough concept, the idea is to take an object divide it three horizontally and three times vertically, essentially giving you a grid system. When applying this to a web page it usually takes the whole page itself. A good example of this would be the sea lion art store in homers web site. I feel the main usage you could get out of this is using the grid system to organized galleries or create a type od symmetry in your site, this seems to be what the utilize in organizing the merchandise.   </p>

                <!--second principle -->
                <pre class="dp-headline-2">White Space and Clean Design   <a href="https://www.google.com/">Sea lion art store</a></pre>
                <p class="dp-paragraph-2"> White Space and Clean Design is what I would call a very base and elegant way to design a site it means to allow for white and space between different elements, keeping the focus on the main subject matter. the idea behind this concept is to make the site itself seem less chaotic. The focus point becomes more on what the site contains, and less on the fillers and things that do not really have a purpose to them. A perfect example to this would be the google home page. It is straight and to the point, dead center of the full page is the google logo and a text bar for you to search, the rest of the page is empty and holds to real focus points.</p>

                <p class="dp-paragraph-3">A painting of your temple, or a painting of your mountain, these painting give your home what it needs. We believe in art to serve as focus of joy in your home. The artwork we create is filled with time from the artist and thought put into each painting. Each piece of artwork speaks a theme or message to the viewer we hope all can enjoy with every one of our artworks. Quality is an important motto for us as we create these paintings, we want you to be able to go home with a painting you fall in love with the view, strokes, color choice, message conveyed, etc. We are also always looking for suggestions for new ideas our customers want and are willing to try new things.  So, feel free to message us anytime! </p>
