                <pre class="dp-headline-1">Rule of thirds  <a href="https://www.sealionart.com/store.html">Sea lion art store</a></pre>
                <p class="dp-paragraph-1">The rule of thirds is a simple enough concept, the idea is to take an object divide it three horizontally and three times vertically, essentially giving you a grid system. When applying this to a web page it usually takes the whole page itself. A good example of this would be the sea lion art store in homers web site. I feel the main usage you could get out of this is using the grid system to organized galleries or create a type od symmetry in your site, this seems to be what the utilize in organizing the merchandise.   </p>

                <!--second principle -->
                <pre class="dp-headline-2">White Space and Clean Design   <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google main page</a></pre>
                <p class="dp-paragraph-2"> White Space and Clean Design is what I would call a very base and elegant way to design a site it means to allow for white and space between different elements, keeping the focus on the main subject matter. the idea behind this concept is to make the site itself seem less chaotic. The focus point becomes more on what the site contains, and less on the fillers and things that do not really have a purpose to them. A perfect example to this would be the google home page. It is straight and to the point, dead center of the full page is the google logo and a text bar for you to search, the rest of the page is empty and holds to real focus points.</p>

                <!--third principle -->
                <pre class="dp-headline-3">Visual Hierarchy   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a></pre>
                <p class="dp-paragraph-3">Visual Hierarchy is the basics that I think many of us should seek out in our web development, what is most important for the user to see? This is the makeup of Visual Hierarchy and the most important items should be what we see first. Social media platforms in general seem to take a strong push towards this idea, especially YouTube. In this site we can see almost immediately the main focused things we want to access, all our playlists are ready to go in the top left corner, our subscriptions, even the recommended videos are right at the top.  </p>
